# Ulcervision üöëüß†  
**Smart Foot Ulcer Multi-Class Detection using Decision-Level Fusion**

## üßæ Overview

Ulcervision is a deep learning-based wound classification system designed to assist in the **automated diagnosis of chronic foot ulcers**. It classifies wound images into **six distinct classes**:
- Diabetic
- Pressure
- Venous
- Surgical
- Natural (Healthy)
- Background

Unlike prior research that focused on binary or low-class classification, this project demonstrates the power of **multi-class classification** and **decision-level model fusion**, achieving **state-of-the-art accuracy (89.47%)** on the AZH chronic wound dataset.

## üß† Core Features

- ‚úÖ **Multi-class classification** using 4 pre-trained CNNs
- üîó **Decision-level fusion**: hard voting, soft voting, max-likelihood, and stacking (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- üß∞ Trained on an **augmented dataset of 14,880 images**
- üìà Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- üì¶ Model outputs stored in `.keras` format

## üîç Methodology

We used four ImageNet pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction:

| Model         | Feature Dim | Strength |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| VGG19         | 25,088      | Deep, structured filters |
| DenseNet201   | 1,920       | Dense connections, reuse |
| MobileNetV2   | 1,280       | Lightweight, efficient |
| NASNetMobile  | 1,056       | AutoML-designed |

These models' predictions were fused using the following strategies:

- `Soft Voting` (Weighted by validation accuracy)
- `Hard Voting`
- `Maximum Likelihood`
- `Stacking`: Using **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression**

The **stacking approach with XGBoost** outperformed all others with:

- üìä **Accuracy**: `89.47%`
- üéØ **Macro F1-score**: `0.89`

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Place your dataset under the `dataset/` directory
3. Train individual models via `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`
4. Run `fusion/stacking_fusion.py` to combine predictions
5. Evaluate with `notebooks/evaluate_models.ipynb`

## üìä Results

| Model/Fusion        | Accuracy | F1 (Macro) |
|---------------------|----------|------------|
| VGG19               | 80%      | 0.80       |
| DenseNet201         | 72%      | 0.70       |
| NASNetMobile        | 74%      | 0.74       |
| MobileNetV2         | 72%      | 0.71       |
| Soft Voting         | 83%      | 0.82       |
| Max Likelihood      | 81%      | 0.80       |
| Hard Voting         | 80%      | 0.79       |
| **XGBoost (Stacking)** | **89.47%**  | **0.89**       |
